            <p class="heading2">Welcome to a detailed beginner's guide to Custom Mechanical Keyboards</p><br>
            <p class="heading2">You can expect to learn foundational and in-depth information about custom mechanical keyboards such as what terminology is commonly used and what parts are required to assemble a mechanical keyboard</p>
            <p class="heading2">Firstly, custom mechanical comes in distinct form factors, which are indicated by percentages, namely 60%, 65%, 75%, 80% (TKL), 96% (1800/Compact) and 100% (Full-sized). 60% have alphabets, number row and modifiers. 65% adds on arrow keys. 75% adds on the function row also known as the F row. 80% adds on the navigation cluster. 96% adds on the numpad. 100% adds more space between the section from a 96%. </p>
            <p class="heading2">Secondly, there are 3 main types of mechanical keyboard switches, which are linear, tactile and clicky. As their names imply, linear switches have a linear travel, tactile have a tactile bump and clicky switches have a click sound that accompanies a tactile bump.</p>
